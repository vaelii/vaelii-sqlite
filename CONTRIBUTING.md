# Contributing to vaelii-sqlite

`vaelii-sqlite` is a sibling of the
[Vaelii](https://github.com/vaelii/vaelii) engine, licensed under the
**Apache License 2.0** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). The core engine is
SSPL-licensed; this repo is part of the permissive Apache-2.0 layer, so its
contributor terms are correspondingly lighter.

## Inbound = outbound

By submitting a contribution you agree it is licensed under Apache-2.0 — the
same terms as this repository (Apache-2.0 §5, which already licenses inbound
contributions to the project). **No separate CLA is required** for this repo.

## Sign off your commits (DCO)

Every commit in a pull request must be signed off under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO) (DCO 1.1, by the Linux Foundation),
which certifies you have the right to submit it:

```bash
git commit -s                 # appends Signed-off-by: Your Name <email>
git rebase HEAD~N --signoff   # sign off the last N commits, if you forgot
```

The [DCO GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/dco) checks every commit in a
pull request and blocks the merge if any is missing a sign-off.

## Where this adapter's behaviour is pinned

This repo implements protocols the engine owns, so a patch here answers to a
contract written somewhere else. `vaelii.impl.protocols` is that contract and the
engine's in-memory store is the reference: the tests in `test/` assert that this
adapter answers what the reference answers, op for op, and a change that moves an
answer is a change to the engine's contract rather than to this repo. Say in the
pull request which protocol moved, and why the reference still agrees.

The SQLite driver and the file format are dependencies, not sources: the SQL
this repo issues is written here, and nothing is copied out of the driver's code
or out of SQLite's own.

## Conventions

Shared coding, commit, and review conventions follow the core engine's
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/vaelii/vaelii/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md):

- **Pull requests target `develop`.** `main` carries releases and is pushed by
  the maintainer, so it is never a pull-request target.
- **A release rewinds `develop`, and we rebase your branch onto it.** Each
  release resets `develop` to the new `main`, which moves your pull request's
  base; GitHub notifies nobody, so we replay your commits onto the new base,
  force-push your branch and say so on the pull request. Resync afterwards with
  `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/<your-branch>`, only if you have
  nothing unpushed there. This needs **Allow edits by maintainers**, the
  checkbox on your pull request: untick it and you get the commands to run
  instead. The `develop` you branched from is kept as `develop-pre-vX.Y.Z`.
- Conventional Commits subjects: `type(scope): subject`, the scope optional.
- Define functions before use; reorder rather than `declare`.
- Comments describe what the code does now, never what it used to do.
- `Co-Authored-By:` / `Co-developed-by:` trailers are **human-only** — welcome
  for human collaborators, never for a tool, bot, or other non-human author.
  The same holds for a commit's `author` and its `committer`, and for the
  `Signed-off-by:` the DCO requires: each names a party making a claim, and a
  tool, bot or agent can make none of them.
- The **`authorship`** check decides that, beside `DCO`. Every author, committer
  and trailer on a pull request has to appear in
  [`.github/AUTHORS.roster`](.github/AUTHORS.roster), which a maintainer writes
  on `develop`, so a first pull request waits on being added — one line, and it
  carries to every later one. That line wants your GitHub login, which is what a
  commit you push is matched on, plus any address you sign a trailer with, which
  is what a trailer is matched on when it names no account. It is a judgement
  about who stands behind an
  account, never about the tools someone writes with. Blocked work is a rebase
  and not a rejection: re-author under whoever signs off, drop the trailers
  naming anyone else, force-push.

Run [`lein gate`](README.md#development) before opening a pull request: it is
`lein lint` and then the suite.
