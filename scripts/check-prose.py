"""Prose style check: literal technical language, against a per-file budget.

Comments, docstrings, doc pages and test names state what the code does. A metaphor
standing in for a mechanism, an evaluative adjective with no measurement behind it, and
a pseudo-cleft that delays the subject are all decodable only by inference, so this
check fails on them. The rule and the substitution table are the engine repo's CONTRIBUTING.md §3.9, which
this repo is held to as well.

Three codes:

  P1  A metaphor where the mechanism has a name. `door` is two different things --
      an API entry point (`assert`, `match`, the served handlers) and a validation
      check (a class-name allowlist, an arity refusal) -- which is the reason it is
      banned rather than renamed in place. `seam` is an interface or an extension
      point; `cone` is an ancestor set or an upward closure.

  P2  Evaluative language carrying no measurement: load-bearing, earns its keep,
      worth writing down, the tempting alternative, the only honest option. Where the
      claim is quantitative, cite the test or bench that measures it (the engine's CONTRIBUTING §8).

  P3  Pseudo-cleft -- `What holds the wrap is a version pin` -- which withholds the
      subject until after the verb.

The sentence-form rules that no regex reaches (name the subject, no fragment, one claim
per sentence, mechanism before reason) are held by review, not by this script.

The budget, `scripts/prose-baseline.txt`, maps a path to the number of hits it is
allowed. A file absent from it is pinned at zero, so a new or rewritten file is clean by
default. Over budget fails; under budget also fails, with the fix being `--update`,
which lowers a count and never raises one. Raising a count is a hand edit carrying a
reason, so a regression appears in the diff rather than in a refresh.

    python3 scripts/check-prose.py            # the check
    python3 scripts/check-prose.py --update   # lower every stale budget
    python3 scripts/check-prose.py --list     # every hit, file:line:code:text
